Relevant files in this folder:

- ./vrpnConfig.pvvr 

    VRPN configuration. Use "Load VR State" in VR panel to apply.

- ./shuttle/shuttle.pvsm

    Shuttle simulation. Animated. Open the ./shuttle/sslv/sslv.pvd
    data file when prompted.  Shuttle should already be scaled and
    centered.

- ./motorBike/motorBike.pvsm

    Full animated motorbike animation. Open the
    ./motorBike/motorBike.foam data file when prompted.

- ./motorBikeScaledStatic/motorBikeScaledStatic.pvsm

    Scaled geometry-only representation of motorBike, not
    animated. Open the
    ./motorBikeScaledStatic/motorBikeScaledStatic.pvd file when
    prompted.

- ./ChesapeakeBay/ChesapeakeBayScaled.pvsm

    Scaled geometry for ChesapeakeBay. Open the
    ./ChesapeakeBay/ChesapeakeBayScaled.pvd file when prompted.

- ./molecule/molecule.pvsm

    BROKEN! For some reason, loading the state file doesn't work. Just
    load the molecule (note that the geometry cannot be
    scaled/transformed -- maybe because it's glyphed?)
